# Wavelet-Based-Denoising-of-Audio-Signals-
Denoised audio signals using Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) in MATLAB. Implemented decomposition, thresholding, and reconstruction to reduce realistic noise. Compared performance with Fourier Transform using Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) across various wavelet types and levels.
